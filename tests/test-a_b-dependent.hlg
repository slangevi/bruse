Moral links:

    Marrying A and B


Triangulating prime component with 4 members:
    A_B_C, C, B, A
This component is a clique of cost 64

Triangulating prime component with 3 members:
    A_B, B, A
This component is a clique of cost 16

Triangulating prime component with 3 members:
    B, A, X
This component is a clique of cost 8


Total cost of triangulation for all prime components is 88


Elimination sequence:

    A_B
    X
    C
    A_B_C
    A
    B


Cliques:

Clique 3, 4 members, table size = 64:
    B, A, A_B_C, C

Clique 2, 3 members, table size = 8:
    B, A, X

Clique 1, 3 members, table size = 16:
    B, A, A_B

Total clique table size: 88


The junction forest:

Creating junction tree with clique 3 as root ...

Cliques 2 and 3 linked, separator has 2 members and table size = 4:
    B, A

Cliques 1 and 2 linked, separator has 2 members and table size = 4:
    B, A


Assignment of potentials to cliques:

    Node A_B assigned to clique 1
    Node A_B_C assigned to clique 3
    Node C assigned to clique 3
    Node B assigned to clique 2
    Node A assigned to clique 2
    Node X assigned to clique 2
