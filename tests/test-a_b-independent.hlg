Moral links:

    Marrying A and B


Triangulating prime component with 4 members:
    A_B_D, D, B, A
This component is a clique of cost 64

Triangulating prime component with 3 members:
    A_B, B, A
This component is a clique of cost 16


Total cost of triangulation for all prime components is 80


Elimination sequence:

    A_B
    D
    A_B_D
    A
    B


Cliques:

Clique 2, 4 members, table size = 64:
    B, A, A_B_D, D

Clique 1, 3 members, table size = 16:
    B, A, A_B

Total clique table size: 80


The junction forest:

Creating junction tree with clique 2 as root ...

Cliques 1 and 2 linked, separator has 2 members and table size = 4:
    B, A


Assignment of potentials to cliques:

    Node A_B assigned to clique 1
    Node A_B_D assigned to clique 2
    Node D assigned to clique 2
    Node B assigned to clique 1
    Node A assigned to clique 1
